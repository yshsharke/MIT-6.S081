Why are there missing keys with 2 threads, but not with 1 thread?
Identify a sequence of events with 2 threads that can lead to a key being missing. 

Thread 1 puts <1, 'a'> into the hash table while thread 2 puts <6, 'b> into it.
One thread modify table[i], which overwrite another thread's change to the hash table.
